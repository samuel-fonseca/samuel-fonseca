## 🧑🏽‍🚀 hi, i'm sam!

i'm a husband, a dad, and a fullstack web developer currently focused on building scalable laravel applications.

- 🐘 i love all things ✨php✨ (v.8 and above of course).
- 🦫 **go** is cool too.
- 🐍 i have been bitten by **python**.
- 💾 **bash** has caused me a lot of pain.
- ☕️ **javascript** reminds me of java - not the language!

## 🔭 projects

i have gotten to work on many cool projects over the years, some of my latest projects include:

1. [fordpass](https://github.com/samuel-fonseca/fordpass) -  an api to send a few commands to my car. built with lumen (rip 🪦)
2. [to-do app in go](https://github.com/samuel-fonseca/task-manager-api) - my first stab at building something in go!
